Identifying and addressing user needs is an essential part of the design process. Without a product which will appeal to users success can not be claimed. User stories are helpful to understanding the key program requirements from a user's perspecitive. By writing a use case around the function that a user would complete in the application, developers are able to most accurately execute the program's design to accomplish these goals. 

The agile approach to development really expands the team's ability to complete projects more quickly. One way this happens is through the daily scrum meetings where everyone shares their progress and roadblocks. By sharing roadblocks, team members who have the ability to help overcome these challenges can step in and help the progress continue. 

Being a good team member is about not only making an effort to meet your own goals for the sake of the team, but to lend a hand when one of your team mates needs help. This can be as simple as providing a second set of eyes to review their work, or could be taking on a piece of their workload if they are falling behind.
